Hello!  I created this repo to track [a blog post series](https://dev.to/dbanty/python-rest-api-project-foundations-f61) about Flask, but I never finished it and never will. I actually [stopped using Flask in favor of FastAPI](https://dev.to/dbanty/why-i-m-leaving-flask-3ki6) and recommend you do the same for a truly wonderful experience in creating Python REST APIs.
